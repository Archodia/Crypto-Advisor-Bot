# Crypto-Advisor-Bot

Advisorbot is a command line program that can carry out various tasks to help a cryptocurrency
investor analyse the data available on an exchange (data provided in a csv file).


Example interaction with advisorbot:


advisorbot> Please enter a command, or help for a list of commands

user> avg ETH/BTC ask 10

advisorbot> The average ETH/BTC ask price over the last 10 timesteps was 1.0

user> predict max ETH/BTC ask

advisorbot> The max ask for ETH/BTC might be 0.9



The program was created as an assignment for the Object Oriented Programming module I completed, 
as part of my BSc Computer Science studies with University of London.
